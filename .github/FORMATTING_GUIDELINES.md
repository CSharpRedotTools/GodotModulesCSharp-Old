# Formatting Guidelines

## Generic

- Please set `Tab Size` to `4` and `End of Line Sequence` to `CRLF`
- Please make sure all classes are wrapped with a namespace
- If a `using` is used across several scripts, consider making it `global` if there will be no conflicts
- Class and method and public variables are `PascalCase` format
- Private and protected variables are `_camelCase` format

## Code Snippets

Please make use of the following snippets

- `nodepath` -> `"[Export] protected readonly NodePath NodePath"`
- `packedscene` -> `"public readonly static PackedScene "`
